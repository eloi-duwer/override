Wee see that the program xors each chars of the string "Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3"
with (322424845 - <our password as an int>),
and checks it againts the string "Congratulations!"

But XOR does not really encrypt, as it is it's own reverse:

if   c = a ^ b
then a = b ^ c

Let's test with our message, with python:

>>> ord('Q') ^ ord('C')
18
>>> ord('}') ^ ord('o')
18
>>> ord('|') ^ ord('n')
18

18 seems to be the good key, 322424845 - 18 = 322424827, that is the good password.
