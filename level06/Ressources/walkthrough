The program reads a username and calculates it's hash
and checks it againts the serial number we entered, if it is long enough

there is a light "anti debug" check with ptrace, we can bypass it easilly and see
the calculated hash for a given uername without having to reverse the hash or find a collision:

gdb level06
(gdb) b *0x080487ba (just after ptrace)
(gdb) b *0x08048866 (before the comparison between the hash and our serial)
(gdb) run
-> Enter Login: get_pwned
-> Enter Serial: 4242 (we don't care for now)
Breakpoint 1, 0x080487ba in auth ()
(gdb) info reg

eax is -1, the call to ptrace failed, let's change it

(gdb) set $eax=0
(gdb) c
Breakpoint 2, 0x08048866 in auth ()
(gdb) x/d $ebp - 0x10
0xffffd6a8:     6235748

the good serial for the user get_pwned is 6235748, we can authenticate now!
