We see that the program tries to copy the file passed in argument, in the folder backups.

We also see that conveniently, the program makes the new file readable by it's own user and group (S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP),
the program ./level08 belongs to the user level09 but to the group 'users',
and the output of `id` shows that we also belong tho the group 'users'

So the program can copy the file /home/users/level09/.pass, and wherever it writes it we can read it...

But when we try: ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass, we get an error:

ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

We see that the program tries to open a file in the folder ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

The folder ./backups//home/users/level09/ does not exist, so the creation fails.

We can try an mkdir -p ./backups//home/users/level09/ but we don't have the rights on the backups folder in our home.

We can however create this folder in /tmp, and it works:

> cd /tmp
> mkdir -p ./backups//home/users/level09/
> ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
> cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass

and we have the flag
